# Counterpoint Craft Kitchen -- Server

As with some of my other personal portfolio work, this project serves as a playground where I can explore and experiment with new (well, new-to-me) technologies.

Still very much in its infancy stage, this Node/ Express server is one part of a loosely-coupled software system.

## System integrations:
  * **Frontend**: React
  * **Backend**: Node/Express
  * **API/ Data management layer**: Ruby on Rails

  [View the Rails server code here.](https://github.com/sds-smith/restaurant_menu_cms)

The menu data is fetched by the Express server from the API, processed and returned to the Frontend. Payment processing via PayPal API is also handled by the backend. A future release will also include Doordash for delivery options.

## Current backend tech stack includes:
  * NodeJS
  * ExpressJS
  * PayPal API integration for payment options and processing

Future iterations will include:
  * Doordash API integration for delivery options

Stay tuned for updates . . .
